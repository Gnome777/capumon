# Capumon Generation One

This is a romhack of Pokémon Red and Blue.

### Description

Capumon Generation One is not a difficulty hack or a catch-em-all, although it modifies the difficulty of boss trainers and allows for a wider selection of Pokémon. This is a reimagining of the first Generation by me, essentially answering the question "What if I was in charge of making the Pokémon games?"

Capumon has a variety of new features that make it stand out, including but not limited to:

- A modified story, that tries to answer some questions that the original games left unanswered
- Bugfixes that attempt to remedy the oddities of Generation 1 battling
- Unique party menu sprites for all Pokémon
- Running Shoes
- Item Descriptions
- Physical/Special Split
- Move Deleter and Move Relearner
- Hyper Training
- In-battle EXP bar
- Enemy Pokémon use PP
- Gym Leaders and the Elite Four can be rematched (except Giovanni)

Some other features:

- Game Corner has been changed to allow for acquisition of otherwise difficult-to-obtain Pokémon
- A wider variety of Gift Pokémon have been added
- Boss trainer battles and Rival battles have been modified. Regular trainers have been left unmodified.
- Some but not all Pokémon have received a type change, based off their Pokédex entry and if I thought their typing made sense. The intent was to reduce duplicate type fatigue (Poison typing and Normal/Flying combinations)
- Pokémon stats have been rounded up to the nearest value ending in 0, i.e. 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, etc. This was to give every Pokémon a universal small buff.
- All wild encounters have been changed to allow for a greater variety of Pokémon to be captured.
- All Pokémon level-up moves have been changed. Generally, a Pokémon will learn a new move every 5 levels up until 50 (or 60 for legendaries). For example, Moltres originally learned 3 moves by level-up, but now learns 12
- Pokemon TM Learnsets have been modified to be more fitting.
